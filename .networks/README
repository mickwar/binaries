This directory contains files where the first line is the network
name (essid) and the second line is the password (key). The files
are referenced by the "wifi" command found in /home/mickey/bin/.

The first argument to "wifi" is expected to be the name of the
file found in /home/mickey/bin/.networks/ to which the command
attempts to connect to that network.

Update (10 Jun 2014): The filename for the network should be
the full network name with one line in the file being the
password. The command ~/bin/wifi should automatically search
for the network to be connected to.
